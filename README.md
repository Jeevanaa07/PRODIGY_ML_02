The project is on customer segmentation which is done using kmeans clustering from sklearn.
Optimal clusters are found by finding the elbow point for the data points.
Based on number of clusters the data is segmented based on income and spending score.
Visualization is made on data to show the segmentation among the customers.
Finally predictions are made on new data points.
